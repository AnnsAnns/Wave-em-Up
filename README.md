### Wave'em UP is a game written for the [Godot Wild Jam](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-18)

#### [Itch.io Page](https://tomger.itch.io/waveem-up)

It features a randomly generated desert map, enemies, guns and sick 80s' beats. 

This repository is really messy as you could expect from a Jam game that got stuck in development hell. It features a lot of broken and unusued scenes and a boss that was nearly 40% done.
